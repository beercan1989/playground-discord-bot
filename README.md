# Playground Discord Bot

Playing around with what can be done with/for discord bots.

## Project configuration
For things like secrets, these are managed via environment variables set when the run command is used.

These can be managed within say IntelliJ IDEA by using the EnvFile plugin and a `.env` file in the root of the project.
```
# The bot token for the Discord application you want to run this under.
TOKEN=abc-123
```

## Discord permissions required
### Privileged Gateway Intents:
* Message Content Intent

### General Permissions:
* Read Messages / View Channels

### Text Permissions:
* Send Messages

## So what am I doing?

Probably just having a quick look at the various libraries, to see how they feel.
